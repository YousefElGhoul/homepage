<h2 id="org01a3f80">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org01a3f80">
<p>
This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>find</b>. GNU <b>find</b>
searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by
evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the
rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known
(the left hand side is false for <i>and</i> operations, true for <i>or</i>), at
which point <b>find</b> moves on to the next file name. If no starting-point
is specified, `.&rsquo; is assumed.
</p>

<p>
If you are using <b>find</b> in an environment where security is important
(for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable
by other users), you should read the `Security Considerations&rsquo; chapter
of the findutils documentation, which is called <b>Finding Files</b> and
comes with findutils. That document also includes a lot more detail and
discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful
source of information.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2db8a12" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2db8a12">OPTIONS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2db8a12">
<p>
The <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> options control the treatment of symbolic links.
Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or
directories to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with
`-&rsquo;, or the argument `(&rsquo; or `!&rsquo;. That argument and any following
arguments are taken to be the expression describing what is to be
searched for. If no paths are given, the current directory is used. If
no expression is given, the expression <b>-print</b> is used (but you should
probably consider using <b>-print0</b> instead, anyway).
</p>

<p>
This manual page talks about `options&rsquo; within the expression list. These
options control the behaviour of <b>find</b> but are specified immediately
after the last path name. The five `real&rsquo; options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-P</b>, <b>-D</b>
and <b>-O</b> must appear before the first path name, if at all. A double
dash <b>--</b> could theoretically be used to signal that any remaining
arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way
<b>find</b> determines the end of the following path arguments: it does that
by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
`-&rsquo;). Now, if a path argument would start with a `-&rsquo;, then <b>find</b> would
treat it as expression argument instead. Thus, to ensure that all start
points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard
patterns expanded by the calling shell are not mistakenly treated as
expression arguments, it is generally safer to prefix wildcards or
dubious path names with either `./&rsquo; or to use absolute path names
starting with &rsquo;/&rsquo;.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>-P</dt><dd>Never follow symbolic links. This is the default behaviour. When
<b>find</b> examines or prints information about files, and the file is a
symbolic link, the information used shall be taken from the properties
of the symbolic link itself.</dd>

<dt>-L</dt><dd><p>
Follow symbolic links. When <b>find</b> examines or prints
information about files, the information used shall be taken from the
properties of the file to which the link points, not from the link
itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or <b>find</b> is unable to
examine the file to which the link points). Use of this option implies
<b>-noleaf</b>. If you later use the <b>-P</b> option, <b>-noleaf</b> will still be
in effect. If <b>-L</b> is in effect and <b>find</b> discovers a symbolic link
to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by
the symbolic link will be searched.
</p>

<p>
When the <b>-L</b> option is in effect, the <b>-type</b> predicate will always
match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to
rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).
Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while <b>find</b> is
executing (for example <b>-delete</b>) can give rise to confusing
behaviour. Using <b>-L</b> causes the <b>-lname</b> and <b>-ilname</b> predicates
always to return false.
</p></dd>

<dt>-H</dt><dd>Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the
command line arguments. When <b>find</b> examines or prints information
about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties
of the symbolic link itself. The only exception to this behaviour is
when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link, and the
link can be resolved. For that situation, the information used is
taken from whatever the link points to (that is, the link is
followed). The information about the link itself is used as a fallback
if the file pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined. If
<b>-H</b> is in effect and one of the paths specified on the command line
is a symbolic link to a directory, the contents of that directory will
be examined (though of course <b>-maxdepth 0</b> would prevent this).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If more than one of <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> is specified, each overrides the
others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect. Since
it is the default, the <b>-P</b> option should be considered to be in effect
unless either <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> is specified.
</p>

<p>
GNU <b>find</b> frequently stats files during the processing of the command
line itself, before any searching has begun. These options also affect
how those arguments are processed. Specifically, there are a number of
tests that compare files listed on the command line against a file we
are currently considering. In each case, the file specified on the
command line will have been examined and some of its properties will
have been saved. If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
<b>-P</b> option is in effect (or if neither <b>-H</b> nor <b>-L</b> were specified),
the information used for the comparison will be taken from the
properties of the symbolic link. Otherwise, it will be taken from the
properties of the file the link points to. If <b>find</b> cannot follow the
link (for example because it has insufficient privileges or the link
points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be
used.
</p>

<p>
When the <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> options are in effect, any symbolic links listed
as the argument of <b>-newer</b> will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will
be taken from the file to which the symbolic link points. The same
consideration applies to <b>-newerXY</b>, <b>-anewer</b> and <b>-cnewer</b>.
</p>

<p>
The <b>-follow</b> option has a similar effect to <b>-L</b>, though it takes
effect at the point where it appears (that is, if <b>-L</b> is not used but
<b>-follow</b> is, any symbolic links appearing after <b>-follow</b> on the
command line will be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

<dt>-Olevel</dt><dd><p>
Enables query optimisation. The <b>find</b> program reorders
tests to speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that
is, predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to each
other. The optimisations performed at each optimisation level are as
follows.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Equivalent to optimisation level 1.</li>

<li>This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to the
traditional behaviour. Expressions are reordered so that tests
based only on the names of files (for example <b>-name</b> and <b>-regex</b>)
are performed first.</li>

<li>Any <b>-type</b> or <b>-xtype</b> tests are performed after any tests based
only on the names of files, but before any tests that require
information from the inode. On many modern versions of Unix, file
types are returned by <b>readdir()</b> and so these predicates are
faster to evaluate than predicates which need to stat the file
first. If you use the <b>-fstype <i>FOO</i></b> predicate and specify a
filesystem type <i>FOO</i> which is not known (that is, present in
`/etc/mtab&rsquo;) at the time <b>find</b> starts, that predicate is
equivalent to <b>-false</b>.</li>

<li>At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query optimiser is
enabled. The order of tests is modified so that cheap (i.e. fast)
tests are performed first and more expensive ones are performed
later, if necessary. Within each cost band, predicates are
evaluated earlier or later according to whether they are likely to
succeed or not. For <b>-o</b>, predicates which are likely to succeed
are evaluated earlier, and for <b>-a</b>, predicates which are likely to
fail are evaluated earlier.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The cost-based optimiser has a fixed idea of how likely any given test
is to succeed. In some cases the probability takes account of the
specific nature of the test (for example, <b>-type f</b> is assumed to be
more likely to succeed than <b>-type c</b>). The cost-based optimiser is
currently being evaluated. If it does not actually improve the
performance of <b>find</b>, it will be removed again. Conversely,
optimisations that prove to be reliable, robust and effective may be
enabled at lower optimisation levels over time. However, the default
behaviour (i.e. optimisation level 1) will not be changed in the 4.3.x
release series. The findutils test suite runs all the tests on <b>find</b>
at each optimisation level and ensures that the result is the same.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org123c3e1">
<p>
The part of the command line after the list of starting points is the
<i>expression</i>. This is a kind of query specification describing how we
match files and what we do with the files that were matched. An
expression is composed of a sequence of things:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Tests</dt><dd>Tests return a true or false value, usually on the basis of
some property of a file we are considering. The <b>-empty</b> test for
example is true only when the current file is empty.</dd>

<dt>Actions</dt><dd>Actions have side effects (such as printing something on
the standard output) and return either true or false, usually based on
whether or not they are successful. The <b>-print</b> action for example
prints the name of the current file on the standard output.</dd>

<dt>Global options</dt><dd>Global options affect the operation of tests and
actions specified on any part of the command line. Global options
always return true. The <b>-depth</b> option for example makes <b>find</b>
traverse the file system in a depth-first order.</dd>

<dt>Positional options</dt><dd>Positional options affect only tests or actions
which follow them. Positional options always return true. The
<b>-regextype</b> option for example is positional, specifying the regular
expression dialect for regular expressions occurring later on the
command line.</dd>

<dt>Operators</dt><dd>Operators join together the other items within the
expression. They include for example <b>-o</b> (meaning logical OR) and
<b>-a</b> (meaning logical AND). Where an operator is missing, <b>-a</b> is
assumed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The <b>-print</b> action is performed on all files for which the whole
expression is true, unless it contains an action other than <b>-prune</b> or
<b>-quit</b>. Actions which inhibit the default <b>-print</b> are <b>-delete</b>,
<b>-exec</b>, <b>-execdir</b>, <b>-ok</b>, <b>-okdir</b>, <b>-fls</b>, <b>-fprint</b>, <b>-fprintf</b>,
<b>-ls</b>, <b>-print</b> and <b>-printf</b>.
</p>

<p>
The <b>-delete</b> action also acts like an option (since it implies
<b>-depth</b>).

command line.</dd>

<dt>-follow</dt><dd>Deprecated; use the <b>-L</b> option instead. Dereference
symbolic links. Implies <b>-noleaf</b>. The <b>-follow</b> option affects only
those tests which appear after it on the command line. Unless the <b>-H</b>
or <b>-L</b> option has been specified, the position of the <b>-follow</b>
option changes the behaviour of the <b>-newer</b> predicate; any files
listed as the argument of <b>-newer</b> will be dereferenced if they are
symbolic links. The same consideration applies to <b>-newerXY</b>,
<b>-anewer</b> and <b>-cnewer</b>. Similarly, the <b>-type</b> predicate will always
match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to
rather than the link itself. Using <b>-follow</b> causes the <b>-lname and</b>
<b>-ilname</b> predicates always to return false.</dd>

<dt>-regextype type</dt><dd>Changes the regular expression syntax understood by
<b>-regex</b> and <b>-iregex</b> tests which occur later on the command line. To
see which regular expression types are known, use <b>-regextype help</b>.
The Texinfo documentation (see <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>) explains the meaning of
and differences between the various types of regular expression.</dd>

<dt>-warn, -nowarn</dt><dd>Turn warning messages on or off. These warnings
apply only to the command line usage, not to any conditions that
<b>find</b> might encounter when it searches directories. The default
behaviour corresponds to <b>-warn</b> if standard input is a tty, and to
<b>-nowarn</b> otherwise. If a warning message relating to command-line
usage is produced, the exit status of <b>find</b> is not affected. If the
POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is set, and <b>-warn</b> is also used,
it is not specified which, if any, warnings will be active.</dd>

Global options always return true. Global options take effect even for

If you specify a global option in some other place, <b>find</b> will issue a

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org161a06f">
<p>
Some tests, for example <b>-newerXY</b> and <b>-samefile</b>, allow comparison
between the file currently being examined and some reference file
specified on the command line. When these tests are used, the
interpretation of the reference file is determined by the options <b>-H</b>,
<b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> and any previous <b>-follow</b>, but the reference file is only
examined once, at the time the command line is parsed. If the reference
file cannot be examined (for example, the <b>stat*(2) system call fails
for it), an error message is issued, and *find</b> exits with a nonzero
status.
</p>

<p>
A numeric argument <i>n</i> can be specified to tests (like <b>-amin</b>,
<b>-mtime</b>, <b>-gid</b>, <b>-inum</b>, <b>-links</b>, <b>-size</b>, <b>-uid</b> and <b>-used</b>) as

of the file it points to is always used.</dd>

<dt>-atime n</dt><dd>File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly
/n/*24 hours ago. When find figures out how many 24-hour periods ago
the file was last accessed, any fractional part is ignored, so to

<dt>-cnewer reference</dt><dd>Time of the last status change of the current

<dt>-empty</dt><dd>File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.</dd>

<dt>-executable</dt><dd>Matches files which are executable and directories
which are searchable (in a file name resolution sense) by the current
user. This takes into account access control lists and other
permissions artefacts which the <b>-perm</b> test ignores. This test makes
use of the *access*(2) system call, and so can be fooled by NFS
servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems
implement *access*(2) in the client&rsquo;s kernel and so cannot make use of
the UID mapping information held on the server. Because this test is
based only on the result of the *access*(2) system call, there is no
guarantee that a file for which this test succeeds can actually be
executed.</dd>

<dt>-false</dt><dd>Always false.</dd>

<dt>-fstype type</dt><dd>File is on a filesystem of type <i>type</i>. The valid
filesystem types vary among different versions of Unix; an incomplete
list of filesystem types that are accepted on some version of Unix or
another is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K. You can use
<b>-printf</b> with the %F directive to see the types of your filesystems.</dd>

<dt>-gid n</dt><dd>File&rsquo;s numeric group ID is less than, more than or exactly

<dt>-group gname</dt><dd>File belongs to group <i>gname</i> (numeric group ID
allowed).</dd>

<dt>-ilname pattern</dt><dd>Like <b>-lname</b>, but the match is case insensitive.
If the <b>-L</b> option or the <b>-follow</b> option is in effect, this test
returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.</dd>

<dt>-iname pattern</dt><dd>Like <b>-name</b>, but the match is case insensitive. For
example, the patterns `fo*&rsquo; and `F??&rsquo; match the file names `Foo&rsquo;,
`FOO&rsquo;, `foo&rsquo;, `fOo&rsquo;, etc. The pattern `*foo*` will also match a file
called &rsquo;.foobar&rsquo;.</dd>

<dt>-inum n</dt><dd>File has inode number smaller than, greater than or exactly

<dt>-ipath pattern</dt><dd>Like <b>-path</b>. but the match is case insensitive.</dd>

<dt>-iregex pattern</dt><dd>Like <b>-regex</b>, but the match is case insensitive.</dd>

<dt>-links n</dt><dd>File has less than, more than or exactly <i>n</i> hard links.</dd>

<dt>-lname pattern</dt><dd>File is a symbolic link whose contents match shell
pattern <i>pattern</i>. The metacharacters do not treat `/&rsquo; or `.&rsquo;

this test returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.</dd>

<dt>-mmin n</dt><dd>File&rsquo;s data was last modified less than, more than or

<dt>-mtime n</dt><dd>File&rsquo;s data was last modified less than, more than or

how rounding affects the interpretation of file modification times.</dd>

<dt>-name pattern</dt><dd>Base of file name (the path with the leading
directories removed) matches shell pattern <i>pattern</i>. Because the
leading directories are removed, the file names considered for a match
with <b>-name</b> will never include a slash, so `-name a/b&rsquo; will never
match anything (you probably need to use <b>-path</b> instead). A warning
is issued if you try to do this, unless the environment variable
POSIXLY_CORRECT is set. The metacharacters (`*&rsquo;, `?&rsquo;, and `[]&rsquo;) match
a `.&rsquo; at the start of the base name (this is a change in
findutils-4.2.2; see section STANDARDS CONFORMANCE below). To ignore a
directory and the files under it, use <b>-prune</b> rather than checking
every file in the tree; see an example in the description of that
action. Braces are not recognised as being special, despite the fact
that some shells including Bash imbue braces with a special meaning in
shell patterns. The filename matching is performed with the use of the
*fnmatch*(3) library function. Don&rsquo;t forget to enclose the pattern in
quotes in order to protect it from expansion by the shell.</dd>

<pre class="example" id="org685946a">

<p>
will print an entry for a directory called <i>./src/misc</i> (if one exists).
To ignore a whole directory tree, use <b>-prune</b> rather than checking
every file in the tree. Note that the pattern match test applies to the
whole file name, starting from one of the start points named on the
command line. It would only make sense to use an absolute path name here
if the relevant start point is also an absolute path. This means that
this command will never match anything:<br />
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org5921ca8">
  find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
</pre>

<p>
Find compares the <b>-path</b> argument with the concatenation of a directory
name and the base name of the file it&rsquo;s examining. Since the
concatenation will never end with a slash, <b>-path</b> arguments ending in a
slash will match nothing (except perhaps a start point specified on the
command line). The predicate <b>-path</b> is also supported by HP-UX <b>find</b>
and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>-perm mode</dt><dd>File&rsquo;s permission bits are exactly <i>mode</i> (octal or
symbolic). Since an exact match is required, if you want to use this
form for symbolic modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode
string. For example `-perm g=w&rsquo; will only match files which have mode
0020 (that is, ones for which group write permission is the only
permission set). It is more likely that you will want to use the `/&rsquo;
or `-&rsquo; forms, for example `-perm -g=w&rsquo;, which matches any file with
group write permission. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for some
illustrative examples.</dd>

<dt>-perm -mode</dt><dd>All of the permission bits <i>mode</i> are set for the file.
Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this is usually the way
in which you would want to use them. You must specify `u&rsquo;, `g&rsquo; or `o&rsquo;
if you use a symbolic mode. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for some
illustrative examples.</dd>

<dt>-perm /mode</dt><dd>Any of the permission bits <i>mode</i> are set for the file.
Symbolic modes are accepted in this form. You must specify `u&rsquo;, `g&rsquo; or
`o&rsquo; if you use a symbolic mode. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for some
illustrative examples. If no permission bits in <i>mode</i> are set, this
test matches any file (the idea here is to be consistent with the
behaviour of <b>-perm -000</b>).</dd>

<dt>-perm +mode</dt><dd>This is no longer supported (and has been deprecated
since 2005). Use <b>-perm <i>/mode</i></b> instead.</dd>

<dt>-readable</dt><dd>Matches files which are readable by the current user.
This takes into account access control lists and other permissions
artefacts which the <b>-perm</b> test ignores. This test makes use of the

UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems implement
*access*(2) in the client&rsquo;s kernel and so cannot make use of the UID
mapping information held on the server.</dd>

<dt>-regex pattern</dt><dd>File name matches regular expression <i>pattern</i>. This
is a match on the whole path, not a search. For example, to match a
file named <i>./fubar3,</i> you can use the regular expression `.*bar.&rsquo; or
`.*b.*3&rsquo;, but not `f.*r3&rsquo;. The regular expressions understood by
<b>find</b> are by default Emacs Regular Expressions (except that `.&rsquo;
matches newline), but this can be changed with the <b>-regextype</b>
option.</dd>

<dt>-samefile name</dt><dd>File refers to the same inode as <i>name</i>. When <b>-L</b>
is in effect, this can include symbolic links.</dd>

<dt>-size n[cwbkMG]</dt><dd><p>
File uses less than, more than or exactly <i>n</i> units
of space, rounding up. The following suffixes can be used:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>`b&rsquo;</dt><dd>for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is
used)</dd>

<dt>`c&rsquo;</dt><dd>for bytes</dd>

<dt>`w&rsquo;</dt><dd>for two-byte words</dd>

<dt>`k&rsquo;</dt><dd>for kibibytes (KiB, units of 1024 bytes)</dd>

<dt>`M&rsquo;</dt><dd>for mebibytes (MiB, units of 1024 * 1024 = 1 048 576 bytes)</dd>

<dt>`G&rsquo;</dt><dd>for gibibytes (GiB, units of 1024 * 1024 * 1024 =
1 073 741 824 bytes)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The size is simply the st_size member of the struct stat populated by
the lstat (or stat) system call, rounded up as shown above. In other
words, it&rsquo;s consistent with the result you get for <b>ls -l</b>. Bear in
mind that the `%k&rsquo; and `%b&rsquo; format specifiers of <b>-printf</b> handle
sparse files differently. The `b&rsquo; suffix always denotes 512-byte
blocks and never 1024-byte blocks, which is different to the behaviour
of <b>-ls</b>.
</p>

<p>
The + and - prefixes signify greater than and less than, as usual;
i.e., an exact size of <i>n</i> units does not match. Bear in mind that the
size is rounded up to the next unit. Therefore <b>-size -1M</b> is not
equivalent to <b>-size -1 048 576c</b>. The former only matches empty
files, the latter matches files from 0 to 1,048,575 bytes.

<dt>-delete</dt><dd>Delete files; true if removal succeeded. If the removal
failed, an error message is issued. If <b>-delete</b> fails, <b>find</b>&rsquo;s exit
status will be nonzero (when it eventually exits). Use of <b>-delete</b>
automatically turns on the `*-depth*&rsquo; option.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<b>Warnings</b>: Don&rsquo;t forget that the find command line is evaluated as an
expression, so putting <b>-delete</b> first will make <b>find</b> try to delete
everything below the starting points you specified. When testing a
<b>find</b> command line that you later intend to use with <b>-delete</b>, you
should explicitly specify <b>-depth</b> in order to avoid later surprises.
Because <b>-delete</b> implies <b>-depth</b>, you cannot usefully use <b>-prune</b> and
<b>-delete</b> together.
</p>

<p>
Together with the <b>-ignore_readdir_race</b> option, <b>find</b> will ignore
errors of the <b>-delete</b> action in the case the file has disappeared
since the parent directory was read: it will not output an error
diagnostic, and the return code of the <b>-delete</b> action will be true.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>-exec command ;</dt><dd>Execute <i>command</i>; true if 0 status is returned.
All following arguments to <b>find</b> are taken to be arguments to the
command until an argument consisting of `;&rsquo; is encountered. The string
`{}&rsquo; is replaced by the current file name being processed everywhere
it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just in arguments where
it is alone, as in some versions of <b>find</b>. Both of these
constructions might need to be escaped (with a `\&rsquo;) or quoted to
protect them from expansion by the shell. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section
for examples of the use of the <b>-exec</b> option. The specified command
is run once for each matched file. The command is executed in the
starting directory. There are unavoidable security problems
surrounding use of the <b>-exec</b> action; you should use the <b>-execdir</b>
option instead.</dd>

<dt>-exec command {} +</dt><dd>This variant of the <b>-exec</b> action runs the
specified command on the selected files, but the command line is built
by appending each selected file name at the end; the total number of
invocations of the command will be much less than the number of
matched files. The command line is built in much the same way that
<b>xargs</b> builds its command lines. Only one instance of `{}&rsquo; is allowed
within the command, and it must appear at the end, immediately before
the `+&rsquo;; it needs to be escaped (with a `\&rsquo;) or quoted to protect it
from interpretation by the shell. The command is executed in the
starting directory. If any invocation with the `+&rsquo; form returns a
non-zero value as exit status, then <b>find</b> returns a non-zero exit
status. If <b>find</b> encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an
immediate exit, so some pending commands may not be run at all. For
this reason <b>-exec <i>my-command</i> &#x2026; {} + -quit</b> may not result in
<i>my-command</i> actually being run. This variant of <b>-exec</b> always
returns true.</dd>

<dt>-execdir command ;</dt><dd></dd>


<dt>-execdir command {} +</dt><dd>Like <b>-exec</b>, but the specified command is
run from the subdirectory containing the matched file, which is not
normally the directory in which you started <b>find</b>. As with -exec, the
{} should be quoted if find is being invoked from a shell. This a much
more secure method for invoking commands, as it avoids race conditions
during resolution of the paths to the matched files. As with the
<b>-exec</b> action, the `+&rsquo; form of <b>-execdir</b> will build a command line
to process more than one matched file, but any given invocation of
<i>command</i> will only list files that exist in the same subdirectory. If
you use this option, you must ensure that your <b>$PATH</b> environment
variable does not reference `.&rsquo;; otherwise, an attacker can run any
commands they like by leaving an appropriately-named file in a
directory in which you will run <b>-execdir</b>. The same applies to having
entries in <b>$PATH</b> which are empty or which are not absolute directory
names. If any invocation with the `+&rsquo; form returns a non-zero value as
exit status, then <b>find</b> returns a non-zero exit status. If <b>find</b>
encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so
some pending commands may not be run at all. The result of the action
depends on whether the <b>+</b> or the <b>;</b> variant is being used; <b>-execdir
<i>command</i> {} +</b> always returns true, while <b>-execdir <i>command</i> {} ;</b>
returns true only if <i>command</i> returns 0.</dd>

<dt>-fls file</dt><dd>True; like <b>-ls</b> but write to <i>file</i> like <b>-fprint</b>. The
output file is always created, even if the predicate is never matched.
See the <b>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</b> section for information about how unusual
characters in filenames are handled.</dd>

<dt>-fprint file</dt><dd>True; print the full file name into file <i>file</i>. If
<i>file</i> does not exist when <b>find</b> is run, it is created; if it does
exist, it is truncated. The file names <i>/dev/stdout</i> and <i>/dev/stderr</i>
are handled specially; they refer to the standard output and standard
error output, respectively. The output file is always created, even if
the predicate is never matched. See the <b>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</b> section
for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.</dd>

<dt>-fprint0 file</dt><dd>True; like <b>-print0</b> but write to <i>file</i> like
<b>-fprint</b>. The output file is always created, even if the predicate is
never matched. See the <b>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</b> section for information
about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.</dd>

<dt>-fprintf file format</dt><dd>True; like <b>-printf</b> but write to <i>file</i> like
<b>-fprint</b>. The output file is always created, even if the predicate is

about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.</dd>

<dt>-ls</dt><dd>True; list current file in <b>ls -dils</b> format on standard
output. The block counts are of 1 KB blocks, unless the environment
variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are
used. See the <b>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</b> section for information about how
unusual characters in filenames are handled.</dd>

<dt>-ok command ;</dt><dd><p>
Like <b>-exec</b> but ask the user first. If the user
agrees, run the command. Otherwise just return false. If the command
is run, its standard input is redirected from <i>/dev/null</i>.
</p>

<p>
The response to the prompt is matched against a pair of regular
expressions to determine if it is an affirmative or negative response.
This regular expression is obtained from the system if the
`POSIXLY_CORRECT&rsquo; environment variable is set, or otherwise from
<b>find</b>&rsquo;s message translations. If the system has no suitable
definition, <b>find</b>&rsquo;s own definition will be used. In either case, the
interpretation of the regular expression itself will be affected by
the environment variables &rsquo;LC_CTYPE&rsquo; (character classes) and
&rsquo;LC_COLLATE&rsquo; (character ranges and equivalence classes).
</p></dd>

<dt>-okdir command ;</dt><dd>Like <b>-execdir</b> but ask the user first in the same
way as for <b>-ok</b>. If the user does not agree, just return false. If
the command is run, its standard input is redirected from <i>/dev/null</i>.</dd>

<dt>-print</dt><dd>True; print the full file name on the standard output,
followed by a newline. If you are piping the output of <b>find</b> into
another program and there is the faintest possibility that the files
which you are searching for might contain a newline, then you should
seriously consider using the <b>-print0</b> option instead of <b>-print</b>. See
the <b>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</b> section for information about how unusual
characters in filenames are handled.</dd>

<dt>-print0</dt><dd>True; print the full file name on the standard output,
followed by a null character (instead of the newline character that
<b>-print</b> uses). This allows file names that contain newlines or other
types of white space to be correctly interpreted by programs that
process the <b>find</b> output. This option corresponds to the <b>-0</b> option
of <b>xargs</b>.</dd>

<dt>-printf format</dt><dd><p>
True; print <i>format</i> on the standard output,
interpreting `\&rsquo; escapes and `%&rsquo; directives. Field widths and
precisions can be specified as with the *printf*(3) C function. Please
note that many of the fields are printed as %s rather than %d, and
this may mean that flags don&rsquo;t work as you might expect. This also
means that the `-&rsquo; flag does work (it forces fields to be
left-aligned). Unlike <b>-print</b>, <b>-printf</b> does not add a newline at
the end of the string. The escapes and directives are:

<p>
A `%&rsquo; character followed by any other character is discarded, but the
other character is printed (don&rsquo;t rely on this, as further format
characters may be introduced). A `%&rsquo; at the end of the format argument
causes undefined behaviour since there is no following character. In
some locales, it may hide your door keys, while in others it may
remove the final page from the novel you are reading.

<p>
The %m and %d directives support the <b>#</b>, <b>0</b> and <b>+</b> flags, but the
other directives do not, even if they print numbers. Numeric
directives that do not support these flags include <b>G</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>D</b>,
<b>k</b> and <b>n</b>. The `-&rsquo; format flag is supported and changes the
alignment of a field from right-justified (which is the default) to
left-justified.

<dt>-prune</dt><dd>True; if the file is a directory, do not descend into it. If
<b>-depth</b> is given, then <b>-prune</b> has no effect. Because <b>-delete</b>
implies <b>-depth</b>, you cannot usefully use <b>-prune</b> and <b>-delete</b>
together. For example, to skip the directory <i>src/emacs</i> and all files
and directories under it, and print the names of the other files
found, do something like this:</dd>
</dl>

<pre class="example" id="org299e760">
  find . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print
</pre>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>-quit</dt><dd>Exit immediately (with return value zero if no errors have
occurred). This is different to <b>-prune</b> because <b>-prune</b> only applies
to the contents of pruned directories, while <b>-quit</b> simply makes
<b>find</b> stop immediately. No child processes will be left running. Any
command lines which have been built by <b>-exec &#x2026; +</b> or <b>-execdir &#x2026;
+</b> are invoked before the program is exited. After <b>-quit</b> is
executed, no more files specified on the command line will be
processed. For example, `*find <i>/tmp/foo</i> <i>/tmp/bar</i> -print -quit*`
will print only `/tmp/foo`.<br />
One common use of <b>-quit</b> is to stop searching the file system once we
have found what we want. For example, if we want to find just a single

Many of the actions of <b>find</b> result in the printing of data which is
under the control of other users. This includes file names, sizes,
modification times and so forth. File names are a potential problem
since they can contain any character except `\0&rsquo; and `/&rsquo;. Unusual
characters in file names can do unexpected and often undesirable things
to your terminal (for example, changing the settings of your function
keys on some terminals). Unusual characters are handled differently by
various actions, as described below.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>-print0, -fprint0</dt><dd>Always print the exact filename, unchanged, even
if the output is going to a terminal.</dd>

<dt>-ls, -fls</dt><dd>Unusual characters are always escaped. White space,
backslash, and double quote characters are printed using C-style
escaping (for example `\f&rsquo;, `\&ldquo;&rsquo;). Other unusual characters are
printed using an octal escape. Other printable characters (for <b>-ls</b>
and <b>-fls</b> these are the characters between octal 041 and 0176) are
printed as-is.</dd>

<dt>-printf, -fprintf</dt><dd>If the output is not going to a terminal, it is
printed as-is. Otherwise, the result depends on which directive is in
use. The directives %D, %F, %g, %G, %H, %Y, and %y expand to values
which are not under control of files&rsquo; owners, and so are printed
as-is. The directives %a, %b, %c, %d, %i, %k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u
and %U have values which are under the control of files&rsquo; owners but
which cannot be used to send arbitrary data to the terminal, and so
these are printed as-is. The directives %f, %h, %l, %p and %P are
quoted. This quoting is performed in the same way as for GNU <b>ls</b>.
This is not the same quoting mechanism as the one used for <b>-ls</b> and
<b>-fls</b>. If you are able to decide what format to use for the output of
<b>find</b> then it is normally better to use `\0&rsquo; as a terminator than to
use newline, as file names can contain white space and newline
characters. The setting of the `LC_CTYPE&rsquo; environment variable is used
to determine which characters need to be quoted.</dd>

<dt>-print, -fprint</dt><dd>Quoting is handled in the same way as for <b>-printf</b>
and <b>-fprintf</b>. If you are using <b>find</b> in a script or in a situation
where the matched files might have arbitrary names, you should
consider using <b>-print0</b> instead of <b>-print</b>.</dd>

(yes) or negative (no) response. See the system&rsquo;s documentation for
*nl_langinfo*(3), in particular YESEXPR and NOEXPR. When
`POSIXLY_CORRECT&rsquo; is not set, the patterns are instead taken from
<b>find</b>&rsquo;s own message catalogue.</dd>

<dt>-newer</dt><dd>Supported. If the file specified is a symbolic link, it is
always dereferenced. This is a change from previous behaviour, which
used to take the relevant time from the symbolic link; see the HISTORY
section below.</dd>

<dt>-perm</dt><dd>Supported. If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is not
set, some mode arguments (for example +a+x) which are not valid in
POSIX are supported for backward-compatibility.</dd>

<dt>Other primaries</dt><dd>The primaries <b>-atime</b>, <b>-ctime</b>, <b>-depth</b>,
<b>-exec</b>, <b>-group</b>, <b>-links</b>, <b>-mtime</b>, <b>-nogroup</b>, <b>-nouser</b>, <b>-ok</b>,
<b>-path</b>, <b>-print</b>, <b>-prune</b>, <b>-size</b>, <b>-user</b> and <b>-xdev</b> are all
supported.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(&rsquo;, `)&rsquo;, negation `!&rsquo; and the
logical AND/OR operators <b>-a</b> and <b>-o</b>.
</p>

<p>
All other options, predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions
beyond the POSIX standard. Many of these extensions are not unique to
GNU find, however.
</p>

<p>
The POSIX standard requires that <b>find</b> detects loops:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The <b>find</b> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
encountered. When it detects an infinite loop, find shall write a
diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its
position in the hierarchy or terminate.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
GNU <b>find</b> complies with these requirements. The link count of
directories which contain entries which are hard links to an ancestor
will often be lower than they otherwise should be. This can mean that
GNU find will sometimes optimise away the visiting of a subdirectory
which is actually a link to an ancestor. Since <b>find</b> does not actually
enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid emitting a diagnostic
message. Although this behaviour may be somewhat confusing, it is
unlikely that anybody actually depends on this behaviour. If the leaf
optimisation has been turned off with <b>-noleaf</b>, the directory entry
will always be examined and the diagnostic message will be issued where
it is appropriate. Symbolic links cannot be used to create filesystem
cycles as such, but if the <b>-L</b> option or the <b>-follow</b> option is in
use, a diagnostic message is issued when <b>find</b> encounters a loop of
symbolic links. As with loops containing hard links, the leaf
optimisation will often mean that <b>find</b> knows that it doesn&rsquo;t need to
call <i>stat()</i> or <i>chdir()</i> on the symbolic link, so this diagnostic is
frequently not necessary.
</p>

<p>
The <b>-d</b> option is supported for compatibility with various BSD systems,
but you should use the POSIX-compliant option <b>-depth</b> instead.
</p>

<p>
The POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable does not affect the behaviour
of the <b>-regex</b> or <b>-iregex</b> tests because those tests aren&rsquo;t specified
in the POSIX standard.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org64c6aa7">
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>LANG</dt><dd>Provides a default value for the internationalization
variables that are unset or null.</dd>

<dt>LC_ALL</dt><dd>If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of
all the other internationalization variables.</dd>

<dt>LC_COLLATE</dt><dd>The POSIX standard specifies that this variable affects
the pattern matching to be used for the <b>-name</b> option. GNU find uses
the *fnmatch*(3) library function, and so support for `LC_COLLATE&rsquo;
depends on the system library. This variable also affects the
interpretation of the response to <b>-ok</b>; while the `LC_MESSAGES&rsquo;
variable selects the actual pattern used to interpret the response to
<b>-ok</b>, the interpretation of any bracket expressions in the pattern
will be affected by `LC_COLLATE&rsquo;.</dd>

<dt>LC_CTYPE</dt><dd>This variable affects the treatment of character classes
used in regular expressions and also with the <b>-name</b> test, if the
system&rsquo;s *fnmatch*(3) library function supports this. This variable
also affects the interpretation of any character classes in the
regular expressions used to interpret the response to the prompt
issued by <b>-ok</b>. The `LC_CTYPE&rsquo; environment variable will also affect
which characters are considered to be unprintable when filenames are
printed; see the section UNUSUAL FILENAMES.</dd>

<dt>LC_MESSAGES</dt><dd>Determines the locale to be used for internationalised
messages. If the `POSIXLY_CORRECT&rsquo; environment variable is set, this
also determines the interpretation of the response to the prompt made
by the <b>-ok</b> action.</dd>

<dt>NLSPATH</dt><dd>Determines the location of the internationalisation message
catalogues.</dd>

<dt>PATH</dt><dd>Affects the directories which are searched to find the
executables invoked by <b>-exec</b>, <b>-execdir</b>, <b>-ok</b> and <b>-okdir</b>.</dd>

<dt>POSIXLY_CORRECT</dt><dd><p>
Determines the block size used by <b>-ls</b> and <b>-fls</b>.
If <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is set, blocks are units of 512 bytes. Otherwise
they are units of 1024 bytes.
</p>

<p>
Setting this variable also turns off warning messages (that is,
implies <b>-nowarn</b>) by default, because POSIX requires that apart from
the output for <b>-ok</b>, all messages printed on stderr are diagnostics
and must result in a non-zero exit status.
</p>

<p>
When POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set, <b>-perm <i>+zzz</i></b> is treated just like
<b>-perm <i>/zzz</i></b> if <i>+zzz</i> is not a valid symbolic mode. When
POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, such constructs are treated as an error.
</p>

<p>
When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, the response to the prompt made by the
<b>-ok</b> action is interpreted according to the system&rsquo;s message
catalogue, as opposed to according to <b>find</b>&rsquo;s own message
translations.

<p>
Files which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<p>
All three of these commands do the same thing, but the first one uses

<h3 id="orgb7c0ca9">Pruning - omitting files and subdirectories</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb7c0ca9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Copy the contents of <i>/source-dir</i> to <i>/dest-dir</i>, but omit files and
directories named <i>.snapshot</i> (and anything in them). It also omits
files or directories whose name ends in <i>&rsquo;~&rsquo;</i>, but not their contents.</li>

<pre class="example" id="org563fc85">
  $ cd /source-dir
  $ find . -name .snapshot -prune -o \( \! -name '*~' -print0 \) \


  | cpio -pmd0 /dest-dir
</pre>

<p>
The construct <b>-prune -o \( ... -print0 \)</b> is quite common. The idea
here is that the expression before <b>-prune</b> matches things which are to
be pruned. However, the <b>-prune</b> action itself returns true, so the
following <b>-o</b> ensures that the right hand side is evaluated only for
those directories which didn&rsquo;t get pruned (the contents of the pruned
directories are not even visited, so their contents are irrelevant). The
expression on the right hand side of the <b>-o</b> is in parentheses only for
clarity. It emphasises that the <b>-print0</b> action takes place only for
things that didn&rsquo;t have <b>-prune</b> applied to them. Because the default
`and&rsquo; condition between tests binds more tightly than <b>-o</b>, this is the
default anyway, but the parentheses help to show what is going on.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Given the following directory of projects and their associated SCM
administrative directories, perform an efficient search for the
projects&rsquo; roots:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example" id="orgb765b91">
  $ find repo/ \
  \( -exec test -d '{}/.svn' \; \
  -or -exec test -d '{}/.git' \; \
  -or -exec test -d '{}/CVS' \; \

<p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd312189">
  repo/project1/CVS
  repo/gnu/project2/.svn
  repo/gnu/project3/.svn
  repo/gnu/project3/src/.svn
  repo/project4/.git
</pre>

<p>
In this example, <b>-prune</b> prevents unnecessary descent into directories
that have already been discovered (for example we do not search
<i>project3/src</i> because we already found <i>project3</i>.svn/), but ensures
sibling directories (<i>project2</i> and <i>project3</i>) are found.

That command is of course not going to work, because the <b>-name</b>
predicate allows exactly only one pattern as argument. Instead of doing
things this way, you should enclose the pattern in quotes or escape the
wildcard, thus allowing <b>find</b> to use the pattern with the wildcard
during the search for file name matching instead of file names expanded
by the parent shell:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org4aa94cc">
  $ find . -name '*.c' -print
  $ find . -name \*.c -print

<p>
There are security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX
standard specifies for <b>find</b>, which therefore cannot be fixed. For
example, the <b>-exec</b> action is inherently insecure, and <b>-execdir</b>
should be used instead.
</p>

<p>
The environment variable <b>LC_COLLATE</b> has no effect on the <b>-ok</b> action.
